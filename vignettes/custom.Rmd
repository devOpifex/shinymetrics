[Shinymetrics](https://shinymetrics.com) will track standard events for you.
However, you may want to track custom events.
For instance, you may want to track when a user creates an account by firing an 
event of `type` "account_creation" where the `value` is the username of the 
account being created.
You will then able to see those events in your dashboard.

For instance the application below, upon account creation, collects the 
username and fires the event.

``` r
library(shiny)
library(shinymetrics)

tracker <- Shinymetrics$new()$track_recommended()

ui <- fluidPage(
  tracker$include(),
  textInput("username"),
  actionButton("create", "Create account")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  shinymetrics_server()

  observeEvent(input$create, {
    shinymetrics_custom_event(
      type = "account_creation",
      value = input$username
    )
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Arguments:

- `type`: Type of the event, allows easily grouping various events into the same category.
- `value`: Value of the event (optional)
- `id`: ID of the event, useful if it is tied to an HTML element.
